\usage{
preservationOneWay(
  network,
  expr.data.files = NULL,
  tissues = c("snig", "putm"),
  permutations = 200,
  maxModuleSize = 5000,
  maxGoldModuleSize = 400,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{The network you want to assess about preservation (can be a full
path and file name. Can be a network object as well.}

\item{expr.data.files}{A list with the expression data used to create the network (1st element) and the
expression data onto which we want the network assessed of preservation (2nd element)}

\item{tissues}{A vector of strings, to name the tissues}

\item{permutations}{The number of random permutations used to construct the null hypothesis. 200 may be a
reasonable number}

\item{maxModuleSize}{All modules over this size in genes will be considered as having as much size as this limit}

\item{maxGoldModuleSize}{The size of the random module to be used as a reference of a totally random module values}

\item{randomSeed}{Seed for the random number generator}
}
\value{
A data frame with modules in the rows and statistics at the columns.
