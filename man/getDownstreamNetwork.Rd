\arguments{
\item{tissue}{A label to use to refer to the results in files and downstream results}

\item{n.iterations}{Number of iterations in the k-means algorithm to refine the
clustering process}

\item{expr.data}{A data frame with expression data, ready to get into WGCNA. Columns
are genes and rows are samples. Column names will be used as gene names in the
analysis product}

\item{beta}{The smoothing parameter of the WGCNA pipeline. If -1, then the method
will suggest one automatically by looking at the R2 between gene connectivity and
Scale Free Topology features}

\item{job.path}{This method will generate a number of files. It needs a folder to write
results}

\item{min.cluster.size}{Minimum number of genes for a group to be considered as cluster
for the tree cutting algorithm to convert from a dendogram to a cluster.}

\item{net.type}{Whether a signed ("signed") or unsigned ("unsigned") network type will be created}

\item{debug}{Set this to true if you want a quick run of the method to test how it works with
a small amount of your genes}

\item{excludeGrey}{If WGCNA detects grey genes, set it to TRUE if you want them removed
from the network before applying k-means}
}
\value{
A file name that can be used to access your network
}
